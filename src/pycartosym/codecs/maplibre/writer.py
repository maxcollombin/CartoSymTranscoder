"""MapLibre / MapBox GL Style writer — CartoSym Style models → style JSON.

The inverse of :mod:`.reader`, and with the same scope: a ``fill`` /
``line`` / ``marker`` / ``label`` symbolizer with constant values maps to
a MapLibre layer (``fill`` / ``line`` / ``circle`` / ``symbol``); a rule
selector maps to the layer ``filter``, except any ``viz.sd`` conjuncts
that match MapLibre's own zoom-range shape, which map to
``minzoom``/``maxzoom`` instead (see :mod:`._zoom`), and a
``sysId dataLayer.id`` equality conjunct, dropped rather than mapped (see
:func:`._filter.strip_datalayer_id` for why) — likewise a
``sysId dataLayer.type`` conjunct whose literal matches the kind of
layer(s) the rule was actually routed to (``vector`` for
fill/line/circle/symbol/background, ``coverage`` for raster; see
:func:`_strip_redundant_datalayer_type`), provably redundant once
routing has already happened. A fill-only symbolizer
carrying the ``vendor.maplibre.layer-type: "background"`` extension (see
:mod:`._layers`) maps to a ``background`` layer instead of ``fill``.
A coverage symbolizer maps separately (see below); graphic element types
other than ``Dot``/``Circle``/``Image``/``Text``, and non-literal values,
raise :exc:`NotImplementedError`.

Each element of ``marker.elements``/``label.elements`` maps to its own
point layer, dispatched by the element's own ``type`` — a ``Dot``/
``Circle`` to a ``circle`` layer, an ``Image`` to a ``symbol`` layer's
``icon-image``, a ``Text`` to a ``symbol`` layer's ``text-field`` — not
by which of ``marker``/``label`` it came from, which this codec treats
symmetrically (see :func:`_point_layer_specs`). A ``Dot`` — ``1-core``,
stroke-only by design — draws as a ``circle`` layer's fill (``color``)
and radius (``size / 2``, ``size`` being a diameter), matching the SLD/SE
codec's own ``Dot`` mapping; unlike a ``2-shapes`` ``Circle``, it has no
outline. The common case of exactly one ``Image`` marker element and
exactly one ``Text`` label element still merges into a single combined
``symbol`` layer (icon + text together), as before this generalisation.

A symbolizer combining more than one of {fill, a full stroke (width or
opacity, not just a plain outline colour), a marker/label point layer}
has no single-layer MapLibre equivalent, so it maps to *several* layers
instead (see :func:`_rule_to_layers`) — one CartoSym rule can expand to
several ``layers`` entries. They share the rule's ``filter``/``minzoom``/
``maxzoom``/``visibility`` and are ordered fill, then line, then the
point layers in ``marker.elements``-then-``label.elements`` order (so a
point layer draws on top of its area/line siblings, the conventional
order); their ``id`` is disambiguated with a ``-fill``/``-line``/
``-circle``/``-symbol`` suffix — several point layers of the *same* kind
get a further numeric suffix (``-circle-1``/``-circle-2``…) — a bare rule
name is kept only when a single layer is produced, unchanged from
before. A stroke with only a ``color`` (no ``width``/``opacity``) stays
inlined as the fill layer's ``fill-outline-color``, as before, rather
than spawning a separate line layer — so ``stroke.dashPattern`` (see
below), which needs a line layer of its own to attach ``line-dasharray``
to, always raises on that inlined path.

``stroke.dashPattern`` maps to ``line-dasharray`` on a ``line``
layer, each length divided by ``stroke.width`` in px — CartoSym/SLD dash
lengths are absolute px, MapLibre's are multiples of the line's own
width (see :func:`_dash_array`). An ``{index, value}`` cascade-override
fragment (``codecs/_cascade.py`` does not resolve indexed overrides for
``dashPattern``, unlike ``elements``) raises, as does a missing/
non-literal ``stroke.width`` to scale by.

``StylingRule.nestedRules`` (a cascading refinement, e.g.
``[attr = value] { ... }`` narrowing a parent rule) has no MapLibre
nesting equivalent — ``layers`` is a flat list — so it is flattened into
independent rules first (see :func:`_flatten_rules`, reusing
:mod:`..._cascade`); a flattened rule with no name of its own inherits
its nearest named ancestor's, disambiguated with a positional suffix. A
rule that draws nothing (visibility/opacity/zOrder only — typically a
cascade's base/gate rule) is dropped rather than raising (see
:func:`_is_empty_of_paint`); one that instead carries unsupported
(raster) content still raises.

A CartoSym style has no data-source concept, so the output declares one
synthetic empty GeoJSON source (``cartosym``) that every vector layer
references — enough to satisfy the MapLibre style specification. A
coverage symbolizer (``singleChannel``/``colorMap``/``hillShading``…)
routes to a *different* synthetic source instead — a placeholder
``raster-dem`` (``cartosym-dem``) — since none of these fields may combine
with ``fill``/``stroke``/``marker``/``label`` in one rule; see
:mod:`._raster` for the achievable subset (``color-relief``/``hillshade``)
and the honest gaps (band selection/arithmetic, per-channel alpha, an
opacity ramp, ``hillShading.factor``, a shading-intensity colour/opacity
ramp).
