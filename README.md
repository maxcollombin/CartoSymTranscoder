# CartoSymTranscoder

This repository contains the code elements required for lossless transcoding between the `*.cscss` and other encodings associated with the [OGC Style & Symbology Conceptual Model standard](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology) into various other encodings.

Development is currently limited to `*.cscss` and [SLD](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sld/).
