"""Exercise the SLD/SE codec against the vendored third-party GeoStyler
SLD 1.1 corpus (``tests/fixtures/geostyler-sld-1.1/``, see its README).

The corpus is split by **directory**:

* ``in-scope/`` — must ``read`` -> ``write`` -> XSD-validate -> ``read`` to a
  Pydantic-model fixed point.
* ``out-of-scope/`` — must raise ``NotImplementedError`` (a clean rejection,
  never another exception type) on ``read`` or ``write``.

Moving a file between the two directories is a deliberate act: the wrong
behaviour then fails loudly. ``test_corpus_layout`` guards the split sizes
and that no fixture is left uncategorised in the corpus root.
